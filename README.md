## New Updates 2.1.1

- **Secure Post Method Triggering:** We've implemented additional security measures to ensure that the post method triggering is secure and protected against potential attacks or unauthorized access.
- **Account Deletion:** The account deletion feature now requires manual confirmation to prevent accidental account deletion. Users cannot access the account deletion process through direct links, ensuring more intentional account deletion actions.

## Some Edge Cases (hard and sensitive bugs)

- **During Gameplay:** Compilation of the score might clash with each other if a player left and finished at the same time, potentially applying the scoring system for both due to the need for a precise server system to track the sub-ticks, providing every millisecond information.
- **Matchmaking Timer:** Matchmaking time is not perfectly precise, with a delay of 1-2 seconds. When a player leaves at the exact moment another player starts, they may be paired up and matched without the first player.

We are continuously working on further improvements and updates to make BMX IQ Race a more enjoyable and secure gaming platform. Happy gaming and learning! üöÄüö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
